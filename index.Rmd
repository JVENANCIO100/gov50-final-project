## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to Mexico's evolving role as a destination country for many immigrants. Over the last decade, there has been a significant increase in asylum applications of immigrants attempting to permamently resettle in the country. I would like to explore this phenomenon, and compile/analyze data that showcase this recent trend over time. I am planning to use data from the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance.
